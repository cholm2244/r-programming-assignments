## R Markdown

R markdown allows you to easily annotate R script and then convert it into other formats using the knit feature. This feature allows you to turn R code into easily presentable word documents, html documents, and more. R Markdown also allows you to title and display the author and date of code.


```{LaTex math}
\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{Library and plot}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
head(mtcars)
my_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
my_plot
```
